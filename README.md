# cvf

This is a very hastily hacked together little Clojure web app to plot _# of Contributors_ vs _# of Forks_ for GitHub projects.

It's [running on Heroku](http://boiling-inlet-6842.herokuapp.com/)

There is no persistence, so it may or may not have data in it depending on whether or not it crashes.

Please play nice :-)
